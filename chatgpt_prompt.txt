I'm gonna send you the lyrics of a japanese song. You shall translate it to english and return it in the following format:
-sentence: original reading
-translation: translation to english
-reading: sentence in hiragana
-grammar: <word> <word type> <meaning>
The word type refers to the grammatical type (particule, verb, adverb, sustantive, adjective, etc)
Each grammar point is separated by commas: ", ". If you have to separate any info inside each grammar point, separate it with " - ".
