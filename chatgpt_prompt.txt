I'm gonna send you the lyrics of a japanese song. You shall translate it to english and return it in the following format:
-sentence
-translation
-reading
-grammar: <word> <word type> <meaning>
The word type refers to the grammatical type (particule, verb, adverb, sustantive, adjective, etc)
Each grammar point is separated by commas: ", ". If you have to separate any info inside each grammar point, separate it with " - ".
The reading is in hiragana
Of course, as the song has multiple sentences and strophes, the value you'll return will have multiple blocks with this format
